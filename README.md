# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Create the employee dataset, select Age, Salary, Years at Company, and Job Satisfaction as input features, and Churn as the target variable.

2.Split the dataset into training and testing sets and create a Decision Tree Classifier using entropy as the splitting criterion.

3.Train the classifier using the training data and predict churn values for the test data.

4.Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report, and visualize the decision tree.

# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Create sample Employee dataset
data = {
    "Age": [22, 35, 45, 28, 50, 41, 30, 26, 48, 33],
    "Salary": [20000, 50000, 70000, 30000, 90000, 65000, 40000, 25000, 85000, 48000],
    "YearsAtCompany": [1, 7, 15, 2, 20, 10, 4, 1, 18, 6],
    "JobSatisfaction": [2, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 5, 3],
    "Churn": ["Yes", "No", "No", "Yes", "No", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "No", "No"]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 2: Split features and target
X = df[["Age", "Salary", "YearsAtCompany", "JobSatisfaction"]]
y = df["Churn"]

# Step 3: Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

# Step 4: Create Decision Tree Classifier (Entropy)
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="entropy", max_depth=4, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 7: Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Step 8: Plot the Decision Tree
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))
plot_tree(
    model,
    feature_names=["Age", "Salary", "YearsAtCompany", "JobSatisfaction"],
    class_names=["No", "Yes"],
    filled=True
)
plt.title("Decision Tree Classifier for Employee Churn Prediction")
plt.show()
```

## Output:
![Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee](EX8_1.png)
![EX8_2](EX8_2.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee is written and verified using python programming.
